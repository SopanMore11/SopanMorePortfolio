Website Requirements:

Homepage / Landing Page

Clean, professional design.

My profile picture, name, and title (e.g., AI Engineer | Computer Vision | Generative AI).

A short About Me section (use resume summary or write a short introduction).

Call-to-action buttons: "Download Resume" (PDF download) and "Contact Me" (links to contact page/form).

Projects: Cards with title, description, tech stack, GitHub/demo links.

Certifications: Logos (if available) + title + issuer.

Skills: Categorized (Programming, AI/ML, Cloud, Tools).

Contact: Contact form (name, email, message) + my social links (LinkedIn, GitHub, X/Twitter).

Database (optional):

Use a free database (SQLite with Prisma, or Supabase free tier, or Firebase free tier) to store projects, skills, experiences, and certifications, so I can update them easily.

Fallback: Use static JSON files if database is not connected.

Design & UI:

Use Tailwind CSS for styling.

Use shadcn/ui components for clean design (cards, buttons, forms).

Ensure mobile responsiveness.

Add light/dark mode toggle.

Extra Features (optional but nice-to-have):

Add animations with Framer Motion.

Blog section (static markdown posts in /content/blog).
